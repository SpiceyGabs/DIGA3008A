            <h2><b><u>Documentation of your IxD (Interaction Design) process:</u></b></h2>
            <p> Interaction design focuses on making user experiences intuitive and easy. My process began by identifying the 
                emotions and reactions I want users to feel when interacting with my website. I want them to feel like they’ve entered a 
                space that’s warm and familiar—almost like visiting a friend’s house. The experience should feel seamless and effortless, 
                so I prioritized simplicity in navigation and interaction.</p>
    
            <p> I started with research into current design trends, particularly those that align with minimalism and a welcoming aesthetic. 
                I looked at user personas to help me map out the different types of people who would interact with the site: my peers, lecturers, and graduate 
                recruiters, and anyone interested in early website development. By understanding their needs, I was able to tailor the site’s flow, content, 
                and style to create an intuitive experience.
            </p>
    
            <p> From there, I sketched wireframes using simple apps on my iPad such as Notebook and Freeform. I must admit, they do need some refining 
                and user input to ensure that the website I end up designing is free from confusion and has clear usability.</p>
            
            <h2><b><u>Goal Alignment:</u></b></h2>
            <p>My primary goals for the website are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Usability:</b> Ensure every user can easily navigate through the pages.</li>
                <li><b>Flow:</b> Create a smooth transition between pages that guides the user effortlessly from one point to the next.</li>
                <li><b>Personalization:</b> Leave users with a sense of having met me and explored my academic and professional journey.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To achieve these goals, I focus on keeping the interface clean, the language conversational, and the overall design cohesive.</p>
            
            <h2><b><u>Information Structure - Content Mapping:</u></b></h2>
            <p>The website’s content structure is organized around key areas of my academic journey and professional interests. Each page serves a purpose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Home Page:</b> A welcoming introduction to who I am with a clear structure.</li>
                <li><b>Blog Page:</b> Weekly updates on my academic progress and reflections.</li>
                <li><b>Essays:</b> Formal academic writing showcasing my thought process.</li>

                <li><b>Portfolio:</b> A showcase of my technical abilities and creativity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My content flow is structured to guide users logically while ensuring smooth navigation.</p>
            
            <h2><b><u>User Flow - Screens, Behaviour, and Decisions:</u></b></h2>
            <p>The user flow ensures an intuitive experience:</p>

            <h2><b><u>List and Explanation of Selected Interface Elements:</u></b></h2>

            <b><u>Sketches and UI Overview:</u></b>
            <p>I experimented with multiple homepage layouts and content structures:</p>
