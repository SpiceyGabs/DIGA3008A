        <b>The History of the web????What the actual heck guys?</b>
            <p> So... (Ill come back to this...I promise) </p>

        <b>16 March 2025, My navigation code broke for the last time! 💀</b> 
            I dont know why, but i just cannot link my homepage to my blogs page, or my blogs to one another. 
            Im just a noob, if even AI couldn’t help, I've checked all my file paths, manually tried to link things, changed and reverted file names,
            consulted, cried, streamed and threw up (just kidding, I'm fine) and still nothing worked the best thing to do is change course. 
            For this reason I've decided to change things up! I had the wonderful idea to use sections and drop down options somewhere on my site, 
            if not now then in future when my skills weren't mid. Could now be that time? Should I add this idea to my original wireframes? No, i 
            think its good to show progress,even though I didnt really have a plan for my blogs page to allow for such things to be accounted for.Okay, 
            Im done ranting about this. Im also done having 404 errors! Those are soooo embarassing, especially with an assignment due date approaching🥲
            
            Time to work! </p>

            <p>Update: with the power of friendship, understanding and common sense, this issue has been resolved! Check out my sepereate blogs pages <a href="../BLOGS/WeeklyBlogs/blogs.html"> HERE😊 </a></p>

<p> My extra things dont work and Im going to cry</p>
<p>Who knew small things like animations, importing logos and something as simple as a grid not working would bring someone so old to tears. I think i need to slow down, but with the amount of work looming i dont think i can, at least not for this next assignments submission. Womp Womp</p>

  <h3>Uh oh, the idea has evolved...</h3>
  <b>Introducing: Webpage Idea Version 1.2</b>
  <p> As the title suggests, the idea I have for my website may or may not have changed. As a designer and someone with many hobbies, interests and creative outlets, I would want users to be able to see this from their first interaction with the website. My peers have inspired me. As such, the homely, apartment style web page idea I had previously has to change.
      My strengths are in video editing and I would like for this to extend into content creation as much as it does for content consumption. Platforms that I consume contentn on include YouTube and Netflix. These will be the new websites I use for inspiration going forward.
      The core values remain the same, I want it to feel clean, well curated and that you, the user, come to feel familiar, welcomed and "at home" on my page as well as with me as a designer. I cant wait for you to see how things will change, and be further expressed going forward!</p>
