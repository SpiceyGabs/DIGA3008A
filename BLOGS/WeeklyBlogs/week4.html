  <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <h3>Well...things are getting serious üò∂ </h3>  
    <time datetime="2025-03-10"> 10 March 2025 </time>  
        <p>
        This week was draining but we move. Lets talk about my goals </p>
        
        <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <article>
            <h3>Showcase My Work & Personality</h3>
                <p>I want my website to give a glimpse into not just my technical abilities, but who I am as a creator. The content should feel like an extension of my personality‚Äîquirky, professional, and tech-savvy. I want users to leave thinking, ‚ÄúWow, I want to know more about this person!‚Äù</p>
            
            <h3>Make a Lasting Impression</h3>
                <p>For recruiters and lecturers, my goal is to make sure they remember me. I want them to be impressed with both my technical skills and how I present them. My website should feel polished yet personal, highlighting my best work and leaving them excited to learn more.</p>
            
            <h3>Easy Exploration & Interaction</h3>
                <p>I want my visitors to not just navigate, but experience the content in a way that feels rewarding. Maybe they uncover things as they scroll or interact with elements‚Äîalmost like discovering little treasures along the way. It shouldn‚Äôt just be about "clicking," but about feeling like they‚Äôre engaged in a mini-adventure.</p>
            
            <h3>What I‚Äôd Like Them to See and Do (Other than Navigate)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discover My Journey: I‚Äôd love to encourage them to explore my development process through my blog and weekly work. Maybe I‚Äôll add an interactive timeline or "project gallery" where they can see my projects evolve over time.</li>
                    <li>Engage with Interactive Elements: I want to include interactive hover effects, animated buttons, or even microinteractions (like subtle animations when they click or scroll) that make my website feel alive. I want them to feel like they‚Äôre in control of their experience.</li>
                    <li>Try Out My Skills: I‚Äôm considering creating a small interactive project or mini-game (something simple like a web-based animation or coding challenge) that lets recruiters and lecturers play around and experience my technical skills firsthand.</li>
                    <li>Personal Touch (Self-Introduction): I want to encourage users to read a section where I talk about my passions and goals, maybe with a fun, interactive "About Me" section where they can click to reveal more about my journey in tech.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>User Flow Diagram:</h3>
                <img src="../../Images/UserFlow.jpeg" 
                    alt="user flow diagram with a mindmap and basic wireframes"
                    height="520"
                    width="502" >

                <p>
                    Above is a user flow diagram that hase wireframes integrated into the image. The rectangles represent the different pages.
                    Every page is a room, every room has a purpose and links to the next one. Every page is interactive, with upwards and downwards scrolling. 
                    I go into this in detail in the design section:<a href="../../Design/Design.html"> here  </a>
