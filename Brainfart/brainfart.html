        <b>16 March 2025, My navigation code broke for the last time! üíÄ</b> 
            I dont know why, but i just cannot link my homepage to my blogs page, or my blogs to one another. 
            Im just a noob, if even AI couldn‚Äôt help, I've checked all my file paths, manually tried to link things, changed and reverted file names,
            consulted, cried, streamed and threw up (just kidding, I'm fine) and still nothing worked the best thing to do is change course. 
            For this reason I've decided to change things up! I had the wonderful idea to use sections and drop down options somewhere on my site, 
            if not now then in future when my skills weren't mid. Could now be that time? Should I add this idea to my original wireframes? No, i 
            think its good to show progress,even though I didnt really have a plan for my blogs page to allow for such things to be accounted for.Okay, 
            Im done ranting about this. Im also done having 404 errors! Those are soooo embarassing, especially with an assignment due date approachingü•≤
            
            Time to work! </p>

            <p>Update: with the power of friendship, understanding and common sense, this issue has been resolved! Check out my sepereate blogs pages <a href="../BLOGS/WeeklyBlogs/blogs.html"> HEREüòä </a></p>
