    <b> User Alignment & Site Content Mapping </b> 
    <p> My portfolio website is designed to cater to three main user groups:
    <li> 1.	Peers & Fellow Students – They’ll be looking for insights into my learning process, design choices, and project work. The Blog page will be a key resource for them. </li>
    <li> 2.	Lecturers & Academic Evaluators – They’ll need clear navigation to my Essays and Portfolio sections to assess my work critically.</li>
    <li> 3.	Graduate Recruiters & Industry Professionals – They’ll be more interested in my Design and Portfolio pages to gauge my technical and creative skills.</li> 
    To align with these user expectations, I structured my site to be intuitive and minimalistic, ensuring that users can effortlessly access the sections they need. The website experience is built around familiarity and ease, mimicking a home-like navigation style where users "walk" through different rooms at a natural pace.</p>


    <b> Mapping Out Site Content & Experience: </b>

    <p> The overall experience prioritizes clarity and usability while maintaining a personalized and engaging feel.
    <ul> 
        <li> Homepage – Serves as the central hub, acting as the "living room" of my website. Users can decide where to go next.</li>
    •	<li>Blog Page – Weekly academic reflections and updates, structured in a collapsible dropdown format to reduce clutter.</li>
    •	<li>Essays – Formal, structured, and categorized by topics/semesters.</li>
    •	<li>Design Page – Showcases wireframes, UI choices, and process documentation. </li>
    •	<li> Portfolio – Highlights final projects in an interactive, visually engaging way.</li> 
    </ul>
    </p> 

    <p> Each page encourages users to stay engaged while keeping navigation simple. Every non-homepage will include a “Back” or "Return to Homepage" button to maintain seamless movement.
    Interface Elements & How They Enhance Usability: 
    •	Navigation Bar – Present only on the homepage, allowing users to explore different sections.
    •	Buttons – Rounded, intuitive, and visually distinct, guiding users without overwhelming them.
    •	Typography Choices – Playful and structured to maintain personality while ensuring readability.
    •	Dropdowns – I might use these in the Blog section to keep past entries accessible but not intrusive. Not now though, I’ll use this later once we know how to add styling with CSS and Java (I can’t wait)
    •	Consistent Colour Palette – Soft pastels and earth tones to maintain a cozy and welcoming aesthetic. </p>


    <b> Reflection on URL Structure, Site Organization & Semantic Markup: </b> 
    <ul>
    <li> My current URL scheme is: https://spiceygabs.github.io/DIGA3008A/index.html</li>
    <li> This is my folder structure:
    <img src = "../Images/DesignImages/">  </li></ul>

    Semantic markup is the practice of using HTML elements that convey meaning about the structure and content of a webpage. Instead of just using <div> and <span> for everything ( especially when we, as noobs, don’t understand them right now), semantic elements like <article>, <section>, <header>, and <footer> help both browsers and search engines understand the purpose of different parts of a webpage.
    This method logically organizes my blog posts, making each week's updates on their own pages. However, while this is manageable now, I recognize that creating a new file each week might become tedious. An alternative could be to structure all blog posts within a single Blogs.html file and dynamically generate content using JavaScript.

    In terms of semantic markup, I am organizing my content using elements like:
    •	<article> for blog posts
    •	<section> for different content areas
    •	<nav> for structured navigation

    This enhances SEO, accessibility, and content clarity, ensuring search engines and assistive technologies can interpret my site effectively. Overall, my current approach to content organization, user experience, and interface design aligns well with my goals. However, I will continue refining my URL structure and semantic choices to improve efficiency as my site evolves.
