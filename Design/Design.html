        <b>Documentation of your IxD (Interaction Design) process: </b>
        Interaction design focuses on making user experiences intuitive and easy. My process began by identifying the emotions and reactions I want users to feel when interacting with my website. I want them to feel like they‚Äôve entered a space that‚Äôs warm and familiar‚Äîalmost like visiting a friend‚Äôs house. The experience should feel seamless and effortless, so I prioritized simplicity in navigation and interaction.
        I started with research into current design trends, particularly those that align with minimalism and a welcoming aesthetic. I looked at user personas to help me map out the different types of people who would interact with the site: my peers, lecturers, and graduate recruiters, and anyone interested in early website development. By understanding their needs, I was able to tailor the site‚Äôs flow, content, and style to create an intuitive experience.
        From there, I sketched wireframes using simple apps on my iPad such as Notebook and Freeform. I must admit, they do need some refining and user input to ensure that the website I end up designing is free from confusion and has clear usability. 

       <b>Goal Alignment:</b> 
        My primary goals for the website are:
        ‚Ä¢	Usability: Ensure every user can easily navigate through the pages.
        ‚Ä¢	Flow: Create a smooth transition between pages that guides the user effortlessly from one point to the next.
        ‚Ä¢	Personalization: Leave users with a sense of having met me and explored my academic and professional journey. They should leave feeling like they‚Äôve gotten to know a little about me in the process‚Äîlike they‚Äôve been invited into my ‚Äúhome.‚Äù
        To achieve these goals, I focus on keeping the interface clean, the language conversational, and the overall design cohesive. This makes sure the user feels like the website isn‚Äôt just an academic project, but a personalized, engaging space that reflects my personality.

        <b>Information Structure - Content Mapping:</b>
        The website‚Äôs content structure is organized around key areas of my academic journey and professional interests. Each page serves a purpose, and I‚Äôve mapped out what content goes where to ensure users understand where to find what they need without overexplaining or any redundancy. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my website:
        ‚Ä¢	The Home Page: A welcoming introduction to who I am. This is where users get a sense of the website's structure and aura, with links to my other pages and a short about me section that ends with a call to action and a footer. 
        ‚Ä¢	Blog Page: Weekly updates on my academic progress, thoughts on web development, and reflection on the learning process.
        ‚Ä¢	Essays: More formal academic writing for anyone interested in the depth of my thought process and analysis of various topics that are to be decided for me. 
        ‚Ä¢	Design: A collection of my design work and ideas, showcasing my skills visually, and any justifications for various style choices.
        ‚Ä¢	Portfolio: The place where my projects will live, demonstrating my technical abilities, design sense, and creativity.
        I‚Äôve designed the content to flow logically from one section to the next, with clear labels and simple navigation to reduce the cognitive load on users whilst also gently ‚Äúforcing‚Äù them to interact with one page at a time. This is done to mimic how visitors can only be in one room of the house at a time. 

       <b> User Flow - Screens, Behaviour, and Decisions:</b> 
        The user flow revolves around providing an intuitive experience where users can easily navigate from one page to the next without feeling lost. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:
        ‚Ä¢	Starting at the Homepage: This is the ‚Äúliving room‚Äù of my website. Users are greeted with a friendly intro and can either scroll down for more or use the navigation bar to go to specific pages.
        ‚Ä¢	Navigation: Each page has a button or link that leads back to the homepage, ensuring that users always know where they are and can return easily.
        ‚Ä¢	Content Exploration: When users visit pages like the Blog or Portfolio, they are encouraged to explore further by offering links to related content or featured works.
        ‚Ä¢	Decisions: The primary decisions are whether to explore more detailed work or return to the homepage. My goal is to keep users engaged but not overwhelmed, offering just enough content at each stage without bombarding them with information. 

        Here‚Äôs how users will interact with my website:
        Entry Point: Homepage
        ‚Ä¢	First Impression: Users land on a visually engaging homepage that immediately introduces who I am and the purpose of my site. A clear menu directs them to the different sections‚ÄîBlogs, Essays, Design, Portfolio and other. 
        ‚Ä¢	User Decisions: 
        o	If they want to explore my academic work ‚Üí They click "Essays"
        o	If they want to see my process, thoughts, and reflections ‚Üí They click "Blogs"
        o	If they‚Äôre interested in my design projects ‚Üí They click "Design"
        o	If they want to see my overall portfolio of work ‚Üí They click "Portfolio"
        o	If they need to contact me ‚Üí They find my email in the About section
        o	
        Navigating Through Sections
        Each section provides a distinct experience, but the navigation remains consistent and clear, so users never feel lost.
        ‚Ä¢	Blogs (Collapsible Dropdown for Weekly Posts)
        o	Users can open a dropdown menu to access individual posts without scrolling through a long page.
        o	Clicking a post opens a full-page view with structured content, dates, and reflections.
        o	At the end of each blog post, there‚Äôs a return-to-home button for easy navigation.
        ‚Ä¢	Essays (Academic and Structured)
        o	A clean, formal layout with Times New Roman ensures readability.
        o	Essays are grouped by topic or semester to help users find relevant content easily.
        o	An option to download PDFs for offline reading might be included later.
        ‚Ä¢	Design (Showcasing Process & UI Exploration)
        o	Users see sketches, wireframes, and notes on my design process.
        o	Interactive images allow users to hover for additional details or project insights.
        o	This section helps recruiters understand my thinking process and problem-solving approach.
        ‚Ä¢	Portfolio (Final Work Showcase)
        o	Each project is displayed as a card or gallery for easy scanning.
        o	Clicking a project opens a detailed page with descriptions, challenges, and outcomes.
        o	This section is the most visually dynamic, using bubble-like fonts for fun and personality.

        Exit Points and Re-Engagement:
        Users should never feel stuck and always have a way to navigate back or explore further.
        ‚Ä¢	Return-to-Home Button: Placed in the top-right corner of all non-home pages, so users can return to the homepage at any time

        List and Explanation of Selected Interface Elements:
        The following interface elements were chosen to support the user‚Äôs navigation and engagement:
        ‚Ä¢	Navigation Bar: A simple, fixed navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to quickly access any section of the website on the home page, but only the home page from everywhere else. It‚Äôs simple and intuitive, reflecting my minimalistic design style and simple user flow. 
        ‚Ä¢	Buttons: Buttons are used throughout the site, with clear text like ‚ÄúReturn to Home page‚Äù or ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrevious‚Äù. These are consistent in size and color for visual coherence.
        ‚Ä¢	Images: Each page includes relevant images (like my anime-inspired drawn selfie on the About page) to create a sense of personality and authenticity.
        ‚Ä¢	Links: Links are in a contrasting color to make them stand out, and hover effects indicate interactivity.
        ‚Ä¢	Footer: A small footer that provides copyright info and links to my social media or contact page.

        Style Process Documentation
        The style of my website is designed to be an extension of me‚Äîfun, inviting, and deeply personal, while maintaining a sense of structure and professionalism. Every design choice is intentional, creating a space that feels both approachable and well-organized.
        Typography - Readability and Personality
        Typography plays a key role in setting the tone of my website. Since different sections of my site serve different purposes, I‚Äôm using a mix of fonts that balance fun and quirkiness with structure and legibility:
        ‚Ä¢	Bubble-like Font for Headings (Portfolio, Blog Titles, etc.): This playful and rounded font choice adds some cozy personality. It reflects my artistic side and makes the portfolio section feel dynamic and engaging, like a visual conversation.
        ‚Ä¢	Times New Roman (or a similar serious serif font) for Essays: A classic and academic font like Times New Roman ensures readability and gives my essay section a polished, intellectual feel. This contrast makes it clear that this section is more structured and formal compared to the rest of the site.
        ‚Ä¢	Sans-serif for Body Text: A clean, modern sans-serif font will be used for the main text to maintain clarity and ease of reading across devices.
        By combining these font styles, I create a visual hierarchy that intuitively guides the user through different sections of the site, making each experience distinct while maintaining cohesiveness.
        Composition - Balance, Hierarchy, and Flow
        I want users to feel like they‚Äôre navigating through a thoughtfully designed space‚Äîeach page acts as a different "room" with its own purpose, yet all are connected seamlessly. My layout choices emphasize:
        ‚Ä¢	Strong Visual Hierarchy: Headings and subheadings will stand out clearly, ensuring users can quickly scan and find what they need.
        ‚Ä¢	Whitespace for Breathing Room: Elements won‚Äôt be crammed together; instead, I‚Äôll use spacing strategically to guide the user's eyes and make content digestible.
        ‚Ä¢	Sectional Design: Each section will have distinct spacing, background elements, and clear navigation cues so users don‚Äôt feel lost.
        ‚Ä¢	
        Interface Elements - Visual Representation and Usability
        To enhance usability and engagement, I‚Äôm incorporating intuitive interface elements:
        ‚Ä¢	Navigation Bar: A clear, persistent nav bar that helps users always know where they are.
        ‚Ä¢	Interactive Buttons: Soft, rounded buttons that encourage interaction, keeping the theme of a friendly and approachable experience.
        ‚Ä¢	Dropdown for Weekly Blogs: A collapsible menu for my blog section, ensuring past posts don‚Äôt overwhelm the page but remain easily accessible.
        ‚Ä¢	Return-to-Home Button: A subtle, top-right-aligned link on every non-homepage, keeping navigation convenient.

        Colour and Visual Aesthetic
        As mentioned in my colour theory section, the palette balances warmth, creativity, and professionalism. My colour choices‚Äîmoss green, pale purple, white smoke, isabelline, almond, coyote, and possibly sage green‚Äîwork together to create an inviting, home-like space that still feels refined and structured.
        These stylistic choices reinforce my main goal: making the website feel like a place users want to stay, explore, and return to. I want it to feel like a digital home‚Äîone where users leave knowing more about me and my work and feeling inspired to come back.

        Sketch out a Range of Possible Designs:
        I started by sketching out multiple variations for the homepage layout and content display. The general composition of the design is fluid, with key sections laid out in a way that makes each section feel like its own room in a home. Some sketches included:
        ‚Ä¢	A grid-based layout for the portfolio to display my work.
        ‚Ä¢	A single-column layout for the blog, focusing on readability and ease of navigation.

        Explore the General Composition and Overview of the Base UI:
        The basic UI will consist of:
        ‚Ä¢	A top navigation bar.
        ‚Ä¢	A central content area where each section will be clearly divided.
        ‚Ä¢	A footer for extra links and credits.
        Visual Aesthetic: The overall aesthetic is modern and warm‚Äîlots of whites, soft pastels, and subtle textures to create a space that feels inviting yet professional. I‚Äôm leaning towards flat design for clarity and usability.

        Fonts - Readability and Legibility:
        I‚Äôve chosen fonts that are simple yet elegant, focusing on readability. The body font is a clean sans-serif, while the headers are slightly bolder to help with content hierarchy.

        Colours - Colour Theory and Relationships:
        When selecting colours for my website, I focused on creating an inviting, calming atmosphere that reflects both my personality and the nature of my work. The colour palette I‚Äôve chosen works together to achieve a harmonious balance of warmth, elegance, and tranquility, enhancing the overall user experience. Each colour serves a specific purpose, from setting the tone to guiding the user‚Äôs eye through the content.
        ‚Ä¢	Primary colour palette:
        o	Moss Green: This earthy tone serves as the foundation of the website, symbolizing growth, balance, and calm. It creates a sense of stability and is easy on the eyes, making it perfect for larger background areas or sections that need a sense of depth.
        o	White Smoke: As a soft, off-white shade, it provides a neutral, clean backdrop that allows the other colours to pop without overwhelming the content. It enhances readability and makes the design feel airy and fresh, giving users a sense of openness.
        o	Almond: A cozy, beige-toned colour, almond adds a touch of warmth and comfort to the site. It‚Äôs ideal for background elements or sections where I want users to feel relaxed and at ease, reinforcing the home-like feel I aim to create.

        ‚Ä¢	Secondary colour palette:
        o	Pale Purple (Pink): A gentle and creative tone, this colour is used sparingly to introduce warmth and a sense of nurturing. It helps highlight important elements, such as headings or buttons, and evokes a feeling of creativity and calm. The soft nature of this pink adds a touch of personality without being too bold.
        o	Isabelline: This warm, neutral shade of yellowish-tan provides balance and harmony. It complements both the moss green and white smoke, acting as a bridge between the more vibrant hues. Isabelline brings a calm, natural feel to the website, contributing to the overall serenity of the space.
        o	Coyote: This muted brownish-grey brings depth and reliability to the palette. It pairs well with the other earthy tones, providing a sense of grounding and security. Used for text or buttons, coyote adds a subtle contrast while maintaining the overall warmth of the design.
        ‚Ä¢	Sage Green: As a potential addition to the secondary palette, sage green would enhance the natural and calming vibe of the site. It pairs beautifully with moss green, reinforcing the theme of growth and tranquility. It could be used to accentuate key design elements like navigation buttons or section headings, adding a fresh, refreshing pop without being overpowering.

        Together, these colours are carefully selected to not only make the website aesthetically pleasing but also to create a space where users feel welcomed, grounded, and connected. Each colour works in harmony with the others, establishing a balance between warmth, serenity, and elegance, which aligns with my goal of providing a homely, personal experience for visitors.


        Composition - Hierarchy, Balance, Harmony:
        I‚Äôve structured the site with a clear visual hierarchy‚Äîimportant content like headings and calls to action are larger, while supporting content is smaller. There‚Äôs an equal balance between text and images, ensuring the page doesn‚Äôt feel cluttered.

        Interface Elements - Visual Representations:
        The buttons are simple rectangles with rounded edges, offering a modern feel. I used color contrast to make them stand out without being too aggressive. When hovered over, the buttons subtly change shade to indicate they‚Äôre clickable.
